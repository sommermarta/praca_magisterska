The program adds two formulations for ordinal regression to LIBSVM. It 
also comes with the infinite ensemble learning and dense format
support that I wrote for LIBSVM. See their README files respectively
for details.

The svm_type 5 is C_RNK, which performs ordinal regression by
reducing with absolute cost + I_{K-1} encoding + regular SVM.
The details can be found in

L. Li and H.-T. Lin.  Ordinal Regression by Extended Binary Classification. To appear in 
the 20th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2006.

The svm_type 6 is SVORIM, which exactly implements the method in

W. Chu  and S. S. Keerthi. New approaches to support vector ordinal regression.
International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-05):145-152, 2005.

svm-predict.c is modified to report the absolute error.
grid.py is modified to select with smaller absolute error.
